<p class='container mx-auto text-2xl'>Robolink CoDrone Lite and Pro are the first educational drones made. Robolink built Snap! which is their own block-based coding environment with beginners in mind. The languages you can use within this environment is Python, Blocky, and Audrino(for Pro only). Both drones are very similar with a few minor differences. The Pro version comes with a buildable remote and Smart Inventor main board. <br />
Regardless of which drone you choose, Robolink will allow users to learn how to customize their own flight patterns, navigate through obstacles, and so much more.
